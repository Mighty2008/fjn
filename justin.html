<h3>cicada</h3>

<p>
    <ol>
 
<li>Cicadas can survive a huge fall as babies, or nymphs. They are about the size of a grain of rice when they drop from a tree branch to the ground and start digging.</p>
<li> The loud whirring or buzzing sound you hear is an all-male cicada chorus. (Females make a much quieter sound by flicking their wings.) Cicadas don’t sing at night, so don’t blame them if you can’t sleep.</p>
<li> Most have red-orange eyes. But occasionally cicadas have blue, white or grayish eyes. Keep on the lookout.</p>

<h3>Panda</h3>
</center>
<p>
    <ol>

<li>Giant pandas grow to between 1.2m and 1.5m, and weigh between 75kg and 135kg. Scientists aren’t sure how long pandas live in the wild, but in captivity they live to be around 30 years old.</p>
<li> Baby pandas are born pink and measure about 15cm – that’s about the size of a pencil! They are also born blind and only open their eyes six to eight weeks after birth.</p>
<li>Sadly, these beautiful bears are endangered, and it’s estimated that only around 1,000 remain in the wild. That’s why we need to do all we can to protect them!</p>
</ol>

    <ol>

<li>Pigeons have excellent hearing abilities. They can detect sounds at far lower frequencies than humans are able to, and can thus hear distant storms and volcanoes.</p>
<li>Pigeons can fly at altitudes up to and beyond 6000 feet, and at an average speed of 77.6 mph. The fastest recorded speed is 92.5 mph.</p>
<li>Pigeons and humans have lived in close proximity for thousands of years. The first recordings of this date back to Mesopotamis, modern Iraq, in 3000bc</p>

    <li> The teddy was named after President Theodore Roosevelt, after he refused to shoot a bear during a 1902 hunting trip.</p>

        <li> They aren’t just for children – 40% of teddy sales are for adults, and a quarter of us still has our childhood companion.

            <li>A teddy has been into space! Magellan T Bear boarded Space Shuttle Discovery in 1995 as part of a school project.</p>
